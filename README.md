Arduino controll obstacle avoiding car with 2 modes manual and auto 

Its my first arduino project where i use ultrasonic sensor and the servo motor to make its happen
see the start of the code for the connections

it have two mode that is :

1. Auto mode
              in this mode the car is controlled my microprocessor itself we cant do any changes in the movement
2. Manual mode
              in this mode we can manually controll the movement but in this mode also i have kept some features of ultrasonic sentor for obstakle avoiding
